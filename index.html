  <h2 class="title">What is menstruation?</h2>
  <p class="explanation">The menstrual cycle is a natural, monthly process that occurs in people with female
    reproductive systems, typically starting during adolescence and continuing until menopause. It involves a series of
    hormonal and physiological changes in the body that prepare it for the possibility of pregnancy. The key stages of
    the menstrual cycle are: menstruation, follicular phase, ovulation, luteal phase. If fertilization does occur, the
    fertilized egg (zygote) will implant into the uterus, and the pregnancy process begins. If not, the uterine lining
    is shed once again, marking the start of a new menstrual cycle.
    <br><br>
    The length of the menstrual cycle can vary from person to person but is typically around 28 days. However, cycles
    can be shorter or longer (ranging from 21 to 35 days) and still be considered normal. Irregularities in the
    menstrual cycle can be influenced by various factors, including stress, illness, hormonal imbalances, and more.
    Tracking your menstrual cycle can be helpful for understanding your reproductive health and can be used for family
    planning or identifying potential issues.

  <!--- Data --->

  <h3 class="title">menses phase</h3>
  <p class="explanation">
    The menses phase starts off the cycle from days 1-5 with menstruation, also known as a period. During this phase,
    the lining of the uterus (endometrium) sheds and is expelled through the vagina. This typically lasts for 3 to 7
    days.
    <br><br>
    If pregnancy does not occur, estrogen and progesterone levels drop, which can contribute to mood swings and
    heightened emotional sensitivity in some women. This phase may also be associated with physical discomfort, which
    can further influence emotions.
  </p>

  <h3 class="title">follicular phase</h3>
  <p class="explanation">
    After menstruation, the body starts preparing for a potential pregnancy from days 1-13. The brain's pituitary gland
    releases follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which stimulates the ovaries to produce several follicles, each
    containing an immature egg (oocyte). These follicles start to mature, but usually, only one will reach full
    maturity.
    <br><br>
    During the first half of the menstrual cycle, estrogen levels gradually rise. This increase in estrogen can have
    mood-lifting effects, promoting feelings of well-being and positivity in many individuals.
  </p>

  <h3 class="title">ovulation phase</h3>
  <p class="explanation">
    Around the middle of the menstrual cycle (day 14), a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) triggers the release of the
    matured egg from one of the ovarian follicles. This is known as ovulation. The egg then travels through the
    fallopian tube, where it can potentially be fertilized by sperm.
    <br><br>
    Around the time of ovulation, estrogen levels peak, and some women may experience increased energy, self-confidence,
    and heightened mood. This is often referred to as the "ovulatory peak."
  </p>

  <h3 class="title">luteal phase</h3>
  <p class="explanation">
    After ovulation (day 15-28), the empty follicle transforms into a structure called the corpus luteum. The corpus
    luteum secretes progesterone and some estrogen, which help prepare the uterine lining for a possible embryo
    implantation. If fertilization doesn't occur, the corpus luteum breaks down, leading to a drop in progesterone and
    estrogen levels, and this triggers the start of a new menstrual cycle.
    <br><br>
    In the second half of the menstrual cycle, both estrogen and progesterone levels rise. Progesterone can have a
    sedative effect, leading to feelings of relaxation but, for some individuals, may also contribute to mood changes
    such as irritability, anxiety, or sadness.

  <h2>Why mycycle?</h2>

  <img src="images/symptoms_graph.jpg" width="500px" />
  <h3>effects of menstruation on women</h3>
  <p>Women often experience varying emotional and physical responses during each menstrual cycle.
    <br><br>
    Women experience emotional responses during their menstrual cycle due to the fluctuation of hormones, primarily
    estrogen and progesterone, which play a significant role in regulating mood and emotions. These hormonal changes can
    influence neurotransmitters in the brain, such as serotonin and dopamine. However, factors such as genetics, stress
    levels, lifestyle, and underlying mental health conditions can also play a role in how hormones affect emotions
    during menstruation. Some women may experience premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or more severe premenstrual dysphoric
    disorder (PMDD), which can lead to more pronounced emotional symptoms.
